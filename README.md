# Minesweeper AI

## Project Description
This project implements an AI to play the classic Minesweeper game that wins almost every time. The AI uses propositional logic and knowledge inference to make decisions, aiming to safely navigate through the minefield without detonating any mines.

## Features
- **AI Game Logic**: Utilizes a knowledge-based approach to identify safe cells and mines.
- **Efficient Knowledge Representation**: Represents the game state with logical sentences, enabling the AI to make informed decisions.
- **Interactive GUI**: Built with Pygame, providing a visual and interactive interface for playing Minesweeper.
- **Safe Move and Random Move Capabilities**: The AI can make safe moves based on its knowledge or random moves when necessary.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pygame for GUI implementation
- Logical inference for AI decision-making

## Installation Instructions
1. Ensure Python and Pygame are installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Run the Python script to start the game.
